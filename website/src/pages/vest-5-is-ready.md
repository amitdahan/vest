# Vest@5 is ready for testing! ðŸŽ‰

I am excited to announce that Vest@5 is now available for testing! With many months of development, this new version is a game-changer in the world of validation libraries. Vest@5 retains all the existing capabilities of its predecessor, Vest@4, while adding a host of new default settings and usability features that make it more user-friendly than ever before.

## What's New in Vest@5?

Here are just a few of the exciting improvements you can expect in Vest@5:

- **Faster Performance:** By default, Vest@5 now stops after the first failure of each field, reducing overhead and improving performance.
- **Improved Usability:** All suite methods are now directly on the suite object, which means there's almost no need to call `suite.get()`.
- **Better Error Handling:** The suite result now has an ordered list of all failures, making it easier to identify the first error in the suite.
- **Singular `getError` and `getWarning` Methods:** These new methods eliminate the need to get the value from an array.
- **Enhanced TypeScript Support:** Added strict types for field names across the suite, making it easier for developers to write clean and reliable code.

These are just a few of the improvements made to Vest@5. I am excited to hear your feedback on these changes and any other thoughts you may have.
